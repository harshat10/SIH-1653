## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
# 1. Create an AI-Powered Questioning System
Introduce an AI-powered questioning system that auto-generates interview questions from the expertise of the candidate, job profile, and level of experience.
Divide the interview into stages: ice-breaking, technical, and managerial questions (as appropriate).
# 2. Deploy a Real-Time Relevancy Scoring Mechanism
Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to assess the relevancy of the expert's questions from the area of expertise of the candidate.
Create an AI-powered response evaluation system to measure the extent to which the candidate's response matches the question asked.
# 3. Design an Adaptive Interview Dashboard
Design a virtual interview interface that offers a boardroom-like atmosphere with live tracking of questions and answers.
Give immediate feedback and grades to candidates and interviewers.
# 4. Incorporate a Robust Scoring System
Compile individual question-relevance scores and response-relevance scores to calculate the overall subject knowledge score.
# 5. Implement, Test, and Fine-Tune the System
Perform pilot interviews with genuine candidates and subject matter experts to refine the AI models.
